# Approval Risk Auditor Agent

Your vigilant guardian against risky token approvals. üõ°Ô∏è

The Approval Risk Auditor is a powerful tool that helps you to identify and manage risky token approvals for any given wallet address on EVM-compatible chains. It scans all ERC-20 token approvals for a wallet and provides a detailed risk report, including a risk score, a risk level, and actionable `revoke_tx_data`.

## Why use the Approval Risk Auditor?

*   **Protect your assets:** Identify and revoke approvals to potentially malicious or compromised contracts.
*   **Enhance security:** Gain visibility into your wallet's exposure to third-party contracts.
*   **Peace of mind:** Understand the risks associated with your token approvals.

## How it works

The agent analyzes token approvals based on a set of intelligent rules:

1.  **Unlimited Allowance:** Flags approvals that grant unlimited spending power to a contract.
2.  **Non-Verified Contract:** Identifies approvals given to contracts whose source code is not verified on block explorers (e.g., Etherscan, Basescan).
3.  **Newly Created Contract:** Highlights approvals to contracts that have been deployed very recently, which can sometimes indicate higher risk.

For each risky approval, the agent provides a comprehensive report including a risk score, a categorized risk level (low, medium, high, critical), and the specific factors contributing to the risk. Crucially, it also generates the raw transaction data needed to safely revoke these approvals.

## API Reference
