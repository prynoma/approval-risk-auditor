üéØ Goal
An x402-gated API that simulates a buy/approve/sell transaction on a mainnet fork to determine if a token is a "honeypot" (i.e., cannot be sold).

üìñ Description
Autonomous trading agents (like one using Fresh Markets Watch) are a primary consumer for new, unvetted tokens. Their biggest risk is buying a "honeypot" token where the smart contract code allows buys but blocks sells, resulting in a 100% loss.

This service acts as an "insurance policy" for agents. Before committing real funds, an agent can pay this API (via x402) to get a rapid, high-fidelity risk report. The service must fork the mainnet, impersonate a wallet, and execute a realistic simulation to provide a simple, machine-readable answer.

üíª Technical Specifications
Job: For a given token, fork the mainnet and simulate a full trade (buy, approve, sell) to check for honeypot code, high taxes, or low liquidity.

Inputs:

token_address - (string) The token contract address to check.

chain_id - (string) The chain to check (e.g., 'base', 'ethereum').

buy_amount_usd - (number, optional, default: 50) The USD-equivalent amount of native ETH to use for the simulation, to ensure realistic price impact.

dex_router - (string, optional) A specific DEX router to test against. If null, the service must find the largest liquidity pool (e.g., via Uniswap v3/v2).

Returns:

is_honeypot - (boolean) The primary signal. true if the sell simulation failed, false otherwise.

buy_tax - (number) The simulated buy tax as a decimal (e.g., 0.05 for 5%).

sell_tax - (number) The simulated sell tax as a decimal (e.g., 0.99 for 99%).

pool_liquidity_usd - (number) The total USD value of liquidity in the pool used for the simulation.

simulation_error - (string | null) The EVM revert reason if the sell failed (e.g., "VM Error: REVERTED. Contract logic blocked sell.")

üèÜ Acceptance Criteria
‚úÖ Must be deployed on a domain and reachable via x402. ‚úÖ The entire simulation and response must be returned in < 15 seconds to be viable for autonomous agents. ‚úÖ Successfully identifies a known safe token (e.g., WETH) as is_honeypot: false. ‚úÖ Successfully identifies a known honeypot token as is_honeypot: true and sell_tax: > 0.9. ‚úÖ Returns accurate (or near-accurate) buy/sell taxes and pool liquidity. ‚úÖ Must support at least Base and Ethereum mainnets.

Done When
An agent can programmatically send a token address and receive a definitive boolean is_honeypot status, plus tax and liquidity data, allowing it to make an automated, low-risk trading decision.
